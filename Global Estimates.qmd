## Approach

I will be utilizing an R script in tidyverse syntax to:

1.  Read the survey data from a .csv file of the movie ratings I collected during assignment #2.

2.  Reshape it in long format

3.  Compute the Global Baseline Estimate

4.  Predict the missing ratings

5.  Produce a move recommendation for each user

### Global Baseline Estimate Formula

The formula for the Global Baseline Estimate is as follows:

r\^ui​=μ+bu​+bi​

Where:

-   μ = global mean rating

-   bu = rˉu​−μ (user bias)

-   bi = rˉi​−μ (movie bias)

### Desired Outcome

Once I've completed my code deliverable, I hope to produce predicted ratings for the movies that each person hadn't rated, select the movie with the highest predicted rating and return a clean recommendation table grouped by user.
