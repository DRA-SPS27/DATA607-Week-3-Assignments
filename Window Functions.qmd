## Approach

### Time Series Dataset - Monthly Housing

I was looking for a dataset that includes a time series for two or more separate items. I used ChatGPT to help me find a dataset that was compelling. I was able to find one on the Mathematics Texas at Tech University website that offered a list of the monthly housing price index (hpi) and the number of existing homes sold (numsold, in thousands) in the USA from January 1991 to April 2013. I will then calculate the yearly average and the six day moving averages for a subset of the items.
